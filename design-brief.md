# Design brief

This document covers what each page should look like

## Music

Music will be the classic image file viewer (https://au.pinterest.com/pin/239183430204345829/) in a windows XP style UI

### - Music viewer

Brings up a Y2K styled window (https://au.pinterest.com/pin/39758409202445911/) (https://au.pinterest.com/pin/35395547064416348/). Lyrics will be to the side of the menu

## Shows

Shows will be windows XP background, and the app icons will be the shows. (https://au.pinterest.com/pin/21532904463315851/) You do have to double-click, as it's an app. Dummy.

### - Individual shows

When you DOUBLE-CLICK click on the app, it opens up a new window with the gig details ()

## About

A popup panel like this (https://au.pinterest.com/pin/31243791160421730/) after clicking a button above a photo of the band - keep the hover effect, it looks dope. But instead of an office assistant, it will be a floating 3d render of our face when selected from the list. A bio will dropdown beneath the floating icon and the scroll list.

## Contact

Something like this for the fields and form layout: (https://au.pinterest.com/pin/25332816647708256/)

Add in personal deets, like number, email

## Media

<!-- Media will be Y2K'ed instagram/pinterest media waterfall style --> NUP NVM

## Other ideas

If you don't move your mouse or touch any arrow keys for 5 mins, the browser loads a screensaver. Either the generating pipes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCpnDTzRAjE&pp=ygUmd2luZG93cyB4cCBtZWRpYSBwbGF5ZXIgdmlzdWFsaXphdGlvbnM%3D) or the bouncing dvd logo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mGuCdlCcNM&pp=ygUmd2luZG93cyB4cCBtZWRpYSBwbGF5ZXIgdmlzdWFsaXphdGlvbnM%3D)
