# To Do
- make nav header reusable for stock screen - make space for other components, like stock search, to live there too 
- see if it's possible to have an event fire when you want the screen to fade. It's complicated to fade from one page to the next.
- pagination for gigs and music

## layouts
- configure routes w/ react router √
- crate error page √
- create layout for merch √
  1. Search bar popup √
  1. Fix filters (desktop) √
  1. Sort by (desktop) √
  1. Filter popup (mobile) √

## logic
- api calls √

## misc
- logic for basic price for each item √
- logic for state being passed to dropdown children √
- logic for sorting items based on category √
  - all TODO's left within merch screen
- all loading logic when things are clicked and when need to be sorted
- check that sorting by stock available is working √
